Abstract
---
The One Big Beautiful Bill cuts federal SNAP spending by $186 billion over ten years through three major changes: capping benefit growth, expanding work requirements to nearly 2 million more recipients, and shifting billions in costs to states. Using nationally representative data from 43,776 SNAP households, we show how these changes will affect food security and state budgets.

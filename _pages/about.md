I am a Ph.D. candidate studying agricultural economics in the [Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. My research interests revolve around general **agricultural policy** with a focus on **farmland**, **taxes**, **farm management**, and **estate planning**.

Beyond research, I am the founder of the "Dyson Farm and Food Tour." This tour aims to provide an opportunity for faculty and graduate students to visit food and agriculture facilities across Cornell and New York State. These visits help motivate future research, foster connections with industry, and provide educational experiences beyond the classroom.

Before attending Cornell, I received my B.S. and M.S. from the Department of Agricultural Economics at Kansas State University.
